  - Built-in observability with metrics, logging, and tracing.
  - Security features like TLS termination and rate limiting.

- **ProxyConf Control Plane**
  - **OpenAPI-Driven Configuration:** Simplifies and standardizes Envoyproxy configuration using OpenAPI specs.
  - **Centralized Policy Management:** Manage API security, routing, and traffic policies across multiple Envoy instances.
  - **Enhanced Security:** Adds layers like authentication, authorization, and custom rate limiting on top of Envoyproxyâ€™s native features.
  - **Real-time Monitoring:** Unified dashboard with real-time insights into API health, performance, and security.
  - **Scalability:** Seamless scaling in distributed, high-availability environments.

- **Proprietary Extensions** (Available as Paid Add-ons)
  - **Request and Response Validation:** Advanced validation mechanisms for API requests and responses, ensuring data integrity and compliance with specifications.
